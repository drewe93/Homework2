The DOM or Document Object Model is the portion of the website that allows for interactivity.
It is generated by the browser when the HTML and CSS code is run and can be interacted with
using Javascript.  The Javascript will be run client side and connects the client to the DOM.
The DOM will allow Javascript to interact with elements of the website that is already defined
by html and CSS.  DOM code will also be automatically updated by the browser to fix errors.
As the document is a object, you can treat it the same when referencing it in javascript.
